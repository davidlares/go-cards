# Golang Cards

This repository is part of the essentials in `GoLang` training, it contains basic instructions and an extensive work on variables, functions and slices (arrays) for static data manipulation, also provides a basic demonstration on how to use third party core `GoLang` libraries such as `IOutil`, `math`, `strings`, etc.

There's some test cases involved too.

The whole project is focused on deck cards, you can create a new deck, print it, shuffle cards, grabs hands (splitting deck) and save and retrieve card decks elements in/from files from the HDD.

## Usage

`go run main.go deck.go`

## Testing

`go test`
